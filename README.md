# Titanic Dataset EDA
This project contains an Exploratory Data Analysis of the Titanic dataset as a part of the Elevate Labs Internship Task 5.

## Objuctive 
project involves an exploratory data analysis (`EDA`) of the famous Titanic dataset. The goal is to analyse the patterns and insights related to passenger survival rates based on different features like: `age, gender, class, fare, and port of embarkation`.
We use Python libraries like `Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib` to perform statistical analysis and create meaningful visualizations.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iz3do4YIGtpSBw5iAw3elwMBE6wJV4KM?usp=sharing)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Key Findings
- Women had a higher chance of survival.
- Higher class passengers had better survival chances.
- Younger passengers survived at a higher rate.
  
## Summary of Key Insights:
- - Majority of passengers did not survive (`around 61% died`).
- Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- Passengers from 1st class had better chances of survival.
- Younger passengers (`especially kids`) survived more.
- People who paid higher fares had higher survival probability.
- Age has a right-skewed distribution with some missing values.
- Younger children (`age <10`) had a higher chance of survival compared to older adults.
- Survivors generally paid higher fares compared to non-survivors.
- Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg (`C`) had a higher survival rate compared to Southampton (`S`) and Queenstown (`Q`).
- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to male passengers.
- The age distribution is right-skewed. Most passengers are between 20 and 40 years old, with fewer very young or elderly passengers.
- More people did not survive than survived (`~62% non-survivors, ~38% survivors`).
- Passengers in 1st class had the highest survival rate, indicating social status influenced survival.
- Fare distribution is heavily right-skewed. Majority paid less than 100, but a few outliers paid extremely high fares.
